## Credits

- The authors of ['Virtual Code Folding'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9151995/).
- [KoiVM](https://github.com/yck1509/KoiVM). Hear me out before you scream 'KoiVM Paste!!' . . the way they organized their virtualizer over there was very nice. So heavy inspiration from that. If you see similar elements, let the record state I am not pasting from Koi, and instead am just organizing under the same general structure. tl;dr this is not KoiVM.
